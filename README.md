### [Multiple Disease Prediction System](http://https://harshranjan-17-multiple-disease-prediction-system-app-zivjfb.streamlit.app/ "Multiple Disease Prediction System")

---

This project is a menu based multiple disease detection system using Machine Learning which will detect if a person is suffering from a disease like diabetes, Heart Disease or Parkinson's disease by taking essential inputs. Here, we have used SVM and Logistic Regression algorithm for classifying the diseases.

#### Built with :

- Python
- Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn
- Streamlit, Pickle

#### Dataset Used :

- [diabetes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set "diabetes")
- [heart disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset "heart disease dataset")
- [parkinson's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/parkinsons-disease-data-set "parkinson's")

#### How to use

- Enter the required input value and press for the test result.
- The model will show wheather the person is having the disease or not.

#### This model is deployed on streamlit
